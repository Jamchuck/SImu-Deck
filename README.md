# Simu-Deck
 This project aims to create a library to quickly simulate the act of drawing from a standard deck for use in other projects 

# Documentation
There are four functions, on to draw the card as a string `draw()` and a function to draw the card as an id `drawid()`.
Along side these there are `draw13()`and `drawid13()` to draw from a deck of 13 card types incase your use case doesn't care about suits.
If id is used you can convert it to the string form, to do this you punch the id into the index field of the array `cards[]` or `cards13[]`
